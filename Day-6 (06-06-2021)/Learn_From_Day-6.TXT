Django is a free and open source web application framework written in Python. A framework is nothing more than a collection of modules that make development easier. 
They are grouped together, and allow you to create applications or websites from an existing source, instead of from scratch.

This is how websites – even simple ones designed by a single person – can still include advanced functionality like authentication support, 
management and admin panels, contact forms, comment boxes, file upload support, and more. In other words, if you were creating a website from 
scratch you would need to develop these components yourself. By using a framework instead, these components are already built, you just need to configure them properly to match your site.

The official project site describes Django as “a high-level Python Web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. 
Built by experienced developers, it takes care of much of the hassle of Web development, so you can focus on writing your app without needing to reinvent the wheel. 
It’s free and open source.”

Django offers a big collection of modules which you can use in your own projects. Primarily, frameworks exist to save developers a lot of wasted time and headaches and 
Django is no different. You might also be interested in learning that Django was created with front-end developers in mind. 
“Django’s template language is designed to feel comfortable and easy-to-learn to those used to working with HTML, like designers and front-end developers. 
But it is also flexible and highly extensible, allowing developers to augment the template language as needed.”

If you’re going to be working with Python, especially for web applications or web design, you’ll want to remember the Django framework. It will certainly come in handy.
