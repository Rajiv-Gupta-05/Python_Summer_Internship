DAY-2 :- Comments, Variables and Datatypes:
.............................................................................................................................................................................

1) comments:  using # or to use triple quotes either''' or """.

2) variable : Python variables do not need explicit declaration to reserve memory space. The declaration happens automatically when you assign a value to a variable. 
            The equal sign (=) is used to assign values to variables.
            The operand to the left of the = operator is the name of the variable and the operand to the right of the = operator is the value stored in the variable.
            A variable is named location used to store data in the memory.
            we learn different ways to assign variables values in python.

3) Data types: 6 types: Numbers, String, List, Tuple, Dictionary, Boolean.
 1: Number datatype:- it stores numeric values. int, float, and complex numbers falls under number datatype.
    type() fun is used to know which class a variable or a value belongs to.
    instance() func is used to check if an object belongs to a particular class.
 2: String Datatype:- we can use single or double quote for defining the string.
 3: List Datatype:- similar to arrays. it is one of the most used datatype in python and is very flexible.
                    they can contain any type of variable, and they can contain as many variables as you wish.
                    all the items in a list do need to be of the same type.

                    Lists are the most versatile of Python's compound data types. A list contains items separated by commas and enclosed within square brackets ([]). 
                    To some extent, lists are similar to arrays in C. One difference between them is that all the items belonging to a list can be of different data type.
                    The values stored in a list can be accessed using the slice operator ([ ] and [:]) with indexes starting at 0 in the beginning of the list and working 
                    their way to end -1. The plus (+) sign is the list concatenation operator, and the asterisk (*) is the repetition operator.

 4: Tuple Datatype:- immutable, once created can't be modified. list are inclosed in bracket and their elements and size can be changed, 
                     while tuple are enclosed in parentheses and can't be updated.

                     A tuple is another sequence data type that is similar to the list. A tuple consists of a number of values separated by commas. 
                     Unlike lists, however, tuples are enclosed within parentheses.
                     The main differences between lists and tuples are: Lists are enclosed in brackets ( [ ] ) and their elements and size can be changed, 
                     while tuples are enclosed in parentheses ( ( ) ) and cannot be updated. Tuples can be thought of as read-only lists.

    error in tuple:- we can use the slicing operator[] to extract items but we cannit change its value.

 5: Dictionary Datatype:- kind of hash table type, are enclosed by curly braces and values can be assigned and accesed using square braces.
