Program Code:

 n1=10
print(n1, "is of type", type(n1))

n2=10.5
print(n2,"n2 is of type", type(n2))
print(n2,"is complex number?", isinstance(10.5,int))

n3=1+2j
print(n3,"is of type", isinstance(1+2j,complex))

Output:
10 is of type <class 'int'>
10.5 n2 is of type <class 'float'>
10.5 is complex number? False
(1+2j) is of type True
