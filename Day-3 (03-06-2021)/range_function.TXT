program code:

# Python Program to 
# show range() basics
  
# printing a number
for i in range(10):
    print(i, end =" ")
print()
  
# using range for iteration
l = [10, 20, 30, 40]
for i in range(len(l)):
    print(l[i], end =" ")
print()
  
# performing sum of natural
# number
sum = 0
for i in range(1, 11):
    sum = sum + i
print("Sum of first 10 natural number :", sum)

Output:
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 
10 20 30 40
